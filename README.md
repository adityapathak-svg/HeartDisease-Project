# HeartDisease-SQL-Project
This repository contains an analysis of a heart disease dataset, aiming to uncover valuable insights related to heart disease risk factors, demographics, treatments, and outcomes. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as age, gender, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, and preventive care. The goal is to better understand the factors contributing to heart disease and how treatment and preventive measures impact patient outcomes.

#Key Objectives.
1.Demographic Analysis: Investigate the distribution of heart disease diagnosis across 
 different age groups and genders.
 
2.Risk Factors Analysis: Explore the relationship between smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and 
 the likelihood of heart disease diagnosis.
 
3.Correlation Analysis: Analyze how cholesterol levels and blood pressure are correlated with 
 heart disease diagnosis.
 
4.Outcome Analysis: Examine the treatment outcomes for patients diagnosed with heart disease.

5.Preventive Care Analysis: Assess the relationship between preventive care visits and the 
 outcome of heart disease diagnoses.
 
#Queries and Findings.
1. Heart Disease Diagnosis by Age Group and Gender
   Objective: Understand the age and gender distribution of heart disease diagnosis.

SQL Query: Investigated heart disease diagnosis categorized by different age groups and genders.
Findings: The analysis revealed significant patterns in diagnosis across various age groups, with higher incidences in older populations, particularly among males.

2. Heart Disease Diagnosis by Risk Factors
    Objective: Examine how risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, and hypertension affect the 
               likelihood of heart disease diagnosis.

SQL Query: Explored the relationship between smoking, diabetes, and hypertension in relation to heart disease.
Findings: Smoking, diabetes, and hypertension were identified as strong risk factors, with a higher prevalence of heart disease among individuals with these conditions.

3. Cholesterol and Blood Pressure Levels vs Heart Disease Diagnosis
Objective: Investigate the correlation between cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and the 
            presence of heart disease.

SQL Query: Analyzed cholesterol and blood pressure data to identify correlations with heart disease diagnosis.
Findings: Elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure levels were significantly associated with a higher risk of heart disease.

4. Heart Disease Treatment Outcome
Objective: Analyze the outcomes of different treatments administered to heart disease patients.

SQL Query: Assessed the effectiveness of various treatments and their impact on the patient outcomes.
Findings: Treatment effectiveness varied, with certain interventions showing higher success rates in improving patient health outcomes.

5. Preventive Care Visits vs Diagnosis Outcome
Objective: Explore the impact of preventive care visits on the outcomes of heart disease diagnoses.

SQL Query: Examined the correlation between preventive care visits and the eventual diagnosis outcomes.
Findings: Frequent preventive care visits were associated with improved outcomes, suggesting the importance of early detection and intervention.

#Methodology:
Data Exploration: The dataset was explored using SQL queries to derive meaningful insights.

Query Development: Each query was designed to address specific aspects of heart disease, including demographic factors, risk factors, medical outcomes, and preventive care.

Analysis and Interpretation: The results from each query were analyzed to identify patterns and correlations that contribute to a deeper understanding of heart disease risk and prevention.

#Conclusion:
This analysis highlights the importance of age, gender, lifestyle factors, and preventive care in the prevention and treatment of heart disease. Key risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and diabetes play a significant role in the likelihood of a heart disease diagnosis. Additionally, effective treatment and regular preventive care visits have shown positive outcomes in improving patient health.
